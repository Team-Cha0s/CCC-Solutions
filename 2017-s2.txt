# split the list into two
# assign a variable(middle) the number/2
# assign a variable  the list[:middle] this would get the first half(lowtidelist)
# assign a variable  the list[middle:] this would get the second half(hightidelist)

# resort the lowtidelist so that it starts with its highest number
# sort the hightidelist so that it starts with the lowest number

# for loop through number 
# create a new list
# add lowtide[0] than hightide[0]

# print out the new list and we got the answer
